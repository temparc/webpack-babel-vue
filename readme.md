# ES6 Starter Project
This project is a quick, custom pre-configured starter to use ES6 and Vue. This boilerplate deliberately does not include a pre-configured back-end to leave development flexibility.

# Features
* Webpack
* Babel
* Vue
* SASS compilation to CSS files
# normalize.css reset

# Installation
* clone the repository
* run ``` npm install ```
* navigate to ```index.html``` in your browser
* set up your back end if necessary

# Build Commands
* npm run build - compiles all SASS and JS and starts watching all files in /src for changes

# Notes
This project does not include any DB or back-end configuration (Express, etc.) - it is strictly a front-end boilerplate.
